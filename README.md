**Finance Tracker**

A simple Qt C++ Finance Tracker built with CMake.  

**What it Does**

The tracker allows you to log and view all income and expense transactions. Your transactions are shown in a table, and the tracker calculates and displays your balance, total income, and total expenses.

**Features**

Each transaction has a date, a type (either income or expense), a category (either work, food & drink, bills & utilities, groceries, shopping, personal, or other), and an amount. The user can add transactions one at a time, and each time, a table with all logged transactions will be updated and displayed. The user's current balance, total income, and total expenses will also be calculated and displayed, and will update with new transactions.
